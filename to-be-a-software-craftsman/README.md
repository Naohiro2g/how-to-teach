# How to teach someone to be a software craftsman

![clover](https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/devine-icons-part-2/128/Cards-Club.png)

**Software craftsman's life is like a card game. More cards you get, more possibilities to make a good play.**

You get new cards for ...

* ... each time you share your knowledge.
* ... each conference you attend.
* ... each book you read.
* ... each time you think "What if ...".
* ... each time you ask "What is this command doing really?".
* ... each article you read.
* ... each time you don't believe in magic and you discover the reason why now it works.
* ... each time you listen to an apprentice with respect.
* ... each time you get a simple solution for a complex problem.
* ... each time you give feedback.
* ... each time you receive feeback.
* ... each time you say "Thank you!" to your co-worker ;)
* ...

Would you help me to complete it?

REMEMBER:
* Don't look for [silver bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet). They don't exist and you won't find your solutions written in a book. 
* You must play with the cards = you must think. 
* Don't forget common sense and pragmatism.
