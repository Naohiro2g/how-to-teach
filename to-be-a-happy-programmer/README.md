**Programmer's life is like a card game. More cards you get, more possibilities to make a good play.**

You get new cards for ...

* ... each conference you attend.
* ... each book you read.
* ... each time you think "What if ...".
* ... each time you ask "What is this command doing really?".
* ... each article you read.
* ... each time you don't believe in magic and you discover the reason why now it works.
* ... each time you say "Thank you!" to your co-worker ;)
* ...

Would you help me to complete it?
